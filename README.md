# Pytorch-Network-Model-Design

## Description

Many tasks of pytorch for learning Network-Model-Design included.

Some of the tasks can be found in [kaggle.com](https://kaggle.com):

* This is just a practice project, and many of the tasks on kaggle.com don't have great results.

* In fact, there is no need to use pytorch for some __machine learning__ tasks (unless you have a high understanding of
  the underlying principles of machine learning), which can lead to some less efficient work.

I'm putting together a collection of simple and helpful tasks that I hope will help myself and others who
want to learn deep learning.

## Examples / Tasks

* Chinese to English
* Next Frame Prediction
* Sentiment Analysis on Movie Review
* Binary Classification with a Bank Churn Dataset
* Multi-Class Prediction of Obesity Risk
* Regression with a Mohs Hardness Dataset
* ......

## Structure

The sample files are in the ```template``` folder.

Note: 
Since the general model parameter file is large, it will not be uploaded to [github.com](https://github.com), if the code does not
have the logic to create this folder, please create your own ```checkpoint``` folder.

```
dataset/      # Folder to store the data set

checkpoint/   # Folder to store model parameters

criterion.py  # loss function

dataset.py    # custom dataset

model.py      # model

train.py      # train the model

test.py       # test the model
```
