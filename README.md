# Pytorch-Network-Model-Design

## Description

Many tasks of pytorch for learning Network-Model-Design.

Most of the tasks can be found in kaggle.com:

* This is just a practice project, and many of the tasks on [kaggle.com](https://kaggle.com) don't have great results.

* In fact, there is no need to use pytorch for some __machine learning__ tasks (unless you have a high understanding of the underlying principles of machine learning), which can lead to some less efficient work.

I'm putting together a collection of simple and helpful tasks for newcomers that I hope will help myself and others who want to learn deep learning.

## Example / Task

* English to Chinese
* Next Frame Prediction
* Sentiment Analysis on Movie Review
* Binary Classification with a Bank Churn Dataset
* Multi-Class Prediction of Obesity Risk
* Regression with a Mohs Hardness Dataset
* ......

## Structure

The sample files are in the template folder.

Note: Since the general model parameter file is large, it will not be uploaded to [github.com](https://github.com), if the code does not have the logic to create this folder, please create your own ```parameter``` folder.

```
dataset/     # Folder to store the data set

parameter/   # Folder to store model parameters

criterion.py # loss function

dataset.py   # custom dataset

model.py     # model

train.py     # train the model

test.py      # test the model
```
